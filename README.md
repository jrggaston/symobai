# symobai

This project is a proof of concept of a tool to detect malware in a Linux System by modeling its behavior with machine learning algorithms. 

Further details of the project (architecture, models used and proof of concept results) can be found in "Memoria_Linux_Malware_Detection_System_Symobai.pdf"

DISCLAIMER: The developed software is not intended for comercial use. It is a proof of concept, its correct behavior under unexpected scenarios is not defined. Its only goal is to evaluate if this kind of tools based on AI can complement other malware detections systems such as IDS or EDR.
